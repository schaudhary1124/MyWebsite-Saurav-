What is this?
</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Saurav Chaudhary and this is my first html 
web site that I have ever created. In this web site I will be giving
my image, a web site that I created in High School, and more. But 
firstly let me tell you a little about myself. I was born in a small
country called Nepal, which is also the only country in the world 
without a rectangular shaped flag. My family moved to the US when I 
was around 5 years old, and we have lived in North Carolina for 7+ years
and now have been in Ohio for 6+ years.</p>
<p> Below are some of my favorite colors</p>  
<ol>
  <li>Royal Blue</li>
  <li>Forest Green</li>
  <li>Purple</li>
  <li>Black</li>
</ol>

<p> Just a little heads up, that some content will not work because
the site was create using Google Sites on a school account. And that
some of the documents were also created using a school account, but 
because the account has been removed by the school, the content which 
is linked to the account is now inaccessible.</p>
